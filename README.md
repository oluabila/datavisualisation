# datavisualisation
The goal of this assignment is to design and create three distinct visualisations that
illuminate some aspects of a complex quantitative dataset. A number of datasets have been
provided â€“ these have been selected because they contain a variety of categorical and
quantitative attributes that lend themselves to different visualisation approaches.
Take a look at the different datasets provided and choose one to perform your analysis on.
Develop a couple of initial questions you wish to address (e.g. What is the relationship
between height and weight for Olympic athletes? How does it vary across sports?) and start
to create visualisations to answer them. Your questions will likely evolve and be refined as
you understand the dataset better. You may also wish to create initial exploratory
visualisations (e.g. histograms, scatter plot matrices) to understand your data better and
help frame your questions.
You may perform initial analysis in another tool (e.g. Tableau) but the submitted
visualisations must be presented in Vega-Lite. You may perform data manipulation outside
of the Vega-Lite environment, e.g. using Python, but you must make clear what
transformations / filtering you have performed and make the processed data set available.
